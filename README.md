# Auto-encoder for a memoryless fiber-optical channel

This script uses an auto-encoder (AE) for end-to-end learning of a non-linear memoryless fiber channel. The determines a good constellation and a good receiver. The achievable information rate is also computed. 

This code was is based on the paper

Shen Li, Christian HÃ¤ger, Nil Garcia, and Henk Wymeersch, "Achievable Information Rates for Nonlinear Fiber Communication via End-to-end Autoencoder Learning," in *Proc. European Conference on Optical Communication* (2018) [arXiv:1804.07675](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07675.pdf).
